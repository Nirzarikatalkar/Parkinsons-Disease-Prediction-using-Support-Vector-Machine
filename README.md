# Parkinsons-Disease-Prediction-using-Support-Vector-Machine

**Problem Statement**:  To detect whether or not person is suffering Parkinson's Disease. 

**Source**: The dataset was created by Max Little of the University of Oxford.

**Data Set Information**:
This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 31 people, 23 with Parkinson's disease (PD). 
Each column in the table is a particular voice measure and each row corresponds one of 195 voice recording from these individuals ("name" column). 
The main aim of the data is to discriminate healthy people from those with PD, according to "status" column which is set to 0 for healthy and 1 for PD.
The data is in ASCII CSV format. The rows of the CSV file contain an instance corresponding to one voice recording.

**Model Building and Training**: 
* This is a Classification dataset. We are building a model using Support Vector Machine Algorithm. 
* Model is first trained with training data to detect whether person is suffering from Parkinsons Disease or not. 
* The model is further tested with sample test data and the accuracy of the model was evaluated.
